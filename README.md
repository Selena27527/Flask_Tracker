This app is a video gam tracker and record personal reviews. You would be able to type the game in, choose from the options where you play on such as pc, ps5, xbox and nintendo switch, then add a rating from 1 to 5 stars, then if you are currently playing it, completed, want to play or dropped. it serves as a digital journal for gaming history. 

AI assisted me by helping me how to build a SQLite database to create the tables and so game names and reviews could be linked together. Then when I tried to switch things around it helped me fix the mistakes.
